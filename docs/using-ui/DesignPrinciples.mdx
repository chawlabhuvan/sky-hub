# Design Principles

- **Consistency**: Centralizing a piece of code always brings in consistency as
  long as the appropriate version is used everywhere.

- **Reusability:** A centralized component library ensures that the components
  are not just reusable inside 1 app but across multiple apps.

- **Flexibility:** Comes with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the
  styling solution OOTB and due to it being a utility-first CSS framework, gives
  room to other styling solutions like
  [StyledComponents](https://styled-components.com/),
  [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) etc.

- **Modularity:** Use/import the components as and when you need them. Each
  component can be used as a separate shared package inside a monorepo or can be
  published as a NPM package and be used as a dependency in a stanalone project.
  Create headless and modular components with tools like
  [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [headless ui](https://headlessui.com/),
  [base ui](https://mui.com/base-ui/getting-started/) etc.

- **Maintainability:** Even when your projects expand and become more complex,
  your component library remains coherent and managable. Tools like
  [Nx](https://nx.dev/) and the concept of
  [workspaces](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/workspaces) makes it
  extremely easy to maintain a design system codebase.
