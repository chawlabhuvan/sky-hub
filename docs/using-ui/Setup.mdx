# Setup

## 1. Setup TailwindCSS and PostCSS

- If you are creating apps in the same repository, then add
  `@sky-hub/tailwind` as the dependency in the app's `package.json`:

  ```js
  "dependencies": {
    "@sky-hub/tailwind": "workspace:*",
    // other dependencies...
  }
  ```

  <br />
  <Callout kind='info'>
  	A symlink for tailwind package is already created at the root level.
  </Callout>

- Run the install command (yarn install)

- Create a `tailwind.config.cjs` file in the app

- Import the linked package:

  ```js
  const tailwindConfig = require("@sky-hub/tailwind/config");

  module.exports = tailwindConfig;
  ```

- Create a `postcss.config.cjs` file in the app and add the following:

  ```js
  const postcssConfig = require("@sky-hub/tailwind/config");

  module.exports = postcssConfig;
  ```

<Callout kind='warning'>
	<strong>Recommended:</strong> If the apps are going to be in different
	monorepo (repository), then make sure to publish `@sky-hub/tailwind` package
	(and other necessary packages), install them as any other dependency in the
	repo and then use them as shown above.
</Callout>

## 2. CSS Setup

- Go to your **\_app.tsx** file or the root file and import the following:

  ```js
  import "@sky-hub/tailwind/styles/tailwind.css";
  ```

<Callout kind='warning'>
	<strong>Recommended:</strong> If you have your own custom css to be added, then create the necessary css file/s and import these files at the very top of a global css file and include other css if any.

    Let's say you have the following css files in your app:
    - src/styles/header.css
    - src/styles/footer.css
    - src/styles/main.css

    You can create a new file called `tailwind.css` in your src and import the css files as:

    ```js
    /* css file exported from the package */
    @import '@sky-hub/tailwind/styles/tailwind.css';
    /* Your local css files */
    @import "./styles/header.css";
    @import "./styles/footer.css";
    @import "./styles/main.css";

    /* Your custom styles if any */
    body {
			background-color: #f0f0f0;
		}
		```
		Finally, go to your **\_app.tsx** file or the root file and import the following:

    ```js
  	import './tailwind.css';
		```
</Callout>

## 3. Use The components

- Go to the file where you want to use the components that you have created in
your ui library and import as follows:

```js
import { Button } from "@sky-hub/button";
```

- Checkout the documentation on [Button](?path=/docs/component-button--docs) to
  get the appropriate code for your page.

## 4. Add More

Go to libs/ui and add or compose new components based on the requirements or
simply use

```js
pnpm generate
```
